# AngularProject

Using the README file for brainstorming purposes for now.
Prject requirements:
General Requirements
Project Setup

Use Angular (version 19+) for the front-end. Focus on a MVP(Minimum Viable Product)

Write all logic in TypeScript, and Utilize Signals().

Use Standalone Components, and new @For @If Decorators

Shared Module (SharedModule)

Create a shared module (or file) that bundles common Angular modules, directives, pipes, etc. (e.g., CommonModule, FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule), so you don’t need to import them repeatedly in every standalone component.

Basic CRUD Operations

Demonstrate Create, Read, Update, and Delete for a chosen data entity (e.g., “Song,” “Contact,” “Book,” etc.).

Angular Essentials

Components: At least 3–4 standalone components to organize your UI.

Services: At least one service to handle data logic (add, delete, edit, retrieve).

Templates: Use Angular’s template features (e.g., @For, bindings) to display data and handle user interactions.

Debugging: Use the Angular CLI, console logs, or other debugging tools to ensure your code works as intended.

Layout & Styling

Incorporate your HTML, CSS, and JS skills within the Angular ecosystem.

You may use any CSS framework (Bootstrap, Material, etc.) or custom styling.

Optional Enhancements

Routing: Use Angular Router (standalone mode) to create multiple screens (e.g., list view vs. details/edit view).

Validation: Validate user inputs (e.g., required fields, correct formats).

User Experience: Provide feedback (success/error messages) after each CRUD action.

Four Sample Project Ideas
Choose one of these or propose your own idea that fulfills the same requirements.
Contact List

Entity: “Contacts” with fields like name, phone number, email, and notes.

Create: Add new contact information.

Read: Display a list or table of all contacts.

Update: Edit an existing contact’s details.

Delete: Remove a contact from the list.

Book/Movie Collection

Entity: “Books” or “Movies,” with fields such as title, author/director, year, genre, etc.

Create: Add a new book or movie to your collection.

Read: Display the entire collection in a list or grid format.

Update: Edit the details of an item.

Delete: Remove a book or movie from the collection.

Music Playlist

Entity: “Songs” or “Tracks” with fields like title, artist, album, genre, year.

Create: Add new songs to the playlist.

Read: Show all songs in a table or list view.

Update: Edit existing song details.

Delete: Remove a song from the playlist.

To-Do Task Manager

Entity: “Tasks,” each with title, description, deadline, completed (boolean).

Create: Add a new task.

Read: List all tasks (e.g., in a table or card layout).

Update: Mark tasks as complete or edit task info.

Delete: Remove a task from the list.

Alternative Student-Proposed Projects
You can choose your own CRUD project idea as long as it:

Implements the Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.

Uses Angular 19 with standalone components and a SharedModule.

Employs services for data handling and templates for UI interaction.

If you have questions or want to confirm your idea, check with your instructor.

Deliverables
Source Code

A well-structured Angular 19 project with standalone components, a shared module, and at least one service.

README.md

Setup Instructions: How to install and run (npm install then ng serve, etc.).

Project Overview: Briefly explain the concept (e.g., a music playlist).

CRUD Demonstration: Show how to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

Optional: Add screenshots or a short video link demonstrating the app.

Reflection / Documentation

Summarize any challenges you encountered and how you solved them.

Mention any notable features or design decisions.

Good luck on your Angular 19 CRUD application!
